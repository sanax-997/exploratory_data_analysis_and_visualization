# Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization - Geo-spatial Data and Interactive Visualizations of World Energy Data

## Overview
The "Geo-spatial Data and Interactive Visualizations of World Energy Data" repository is a web application created using Python libraries such as Pandas, Plotly, Dash, and others. It serves as a platform for visualizing and analyzing global energy data. The application allows users to explore energy consumption, electricity sources, CO2 gas emissions, and their correlations for various countries and years. The application comprises several interactive graphs and charts that provide insights into the energy landscape. Users can select a specific year to examine data on energy disparities through a choropleth map, visualize electricity generation sources via an area chart, explore the share of electricity sources with a pie chart, analyze greenhouse gas emissions of the top 10 countries through a bar chart, and examine the correlation between energy consumption and GDP using a scatter plot.
